Currently there is much debate around adding inflation to the current fixed supply of 30,000 YFI tokens, as a means of creating further incentive for team members and core devs to be committed to the project. If this happens, and the total supply of YFI exceeds 30,000 before the resolution date, the market will resolve to \"Yes\".

This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @ElonMusk, then clicking the verified account labeled \"@ElonMusk\" from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @ElonMusk just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00 pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets at expiration exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to expiration of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Elon Musk, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the settlement source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available.

This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @MCuban, then clicking the verified account labeled \"@MCuban\" from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @MCuban just before 3:00 pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00 pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets at expiration exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to expiration of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Mark Cuban, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the settlement source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, the lowest bracket will resolve to \"Yes\". Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, all contracts in this market will resolve as No. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @MarkCuban will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).","outcomes":"[\"Less than 30\", \"30-39\", \"40-49\", \"50-59\", \"60-69\", \"70 or More\"]","outcomePrices":"[\"0.9997594674400644930842844161505988\", \"0.0000007066596823031077340879487419135955\", \"0.00007954429724545784115272946998582285\", \"0.00005345516430393140004890670569082033\", \"0.00004608237715513490603809935983988876\", \"0.00006074406154867966074176036514262072\"]","volume":"52378.583164","active":true,"marketType":"normal","closed":true,"marketMakerAddress":"0x53f6bfc820dD7DF185Da844Fb438dACA02535E2B","updatedBy":3,"createdAt":"2021-02-03T19:55:03.05Z","updatedAt":"2024-04-22T23:24:58.99801Z","closedTime":"2021-02-10 22:04:45+00","wideFormat":true,"new":false,"sentDiscord":false,"mailchimpTag":"null","featured":false,"archived":false,"restricted":false,"volumeNum":52378.58,"liquidityNum":16.05,"endDateIso":"2021-02-10","hasReviewedDates":true,"readyForCron":true,"volume24hr":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1mo":0,"volume1yr":0,"clobTokenIds":"[\"28682327287131437773181973682871424206762304493885776200720101356100691844971\", \"23424080259777450081123298680182628598179920384828995087944724981514394914840\", \"70402690424637905680132014820360222982885868578998509173941934827330742627924\", \"103715173790115967777897357007049501199130796586523099618825577690017725241814\", \"30542439888304510853013738766988953160813527403370555915419886966410552265293\", \"91485757175942636972192959182930243287300175686960077399875643858914321023817\"]","fpmmLive":true,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"events":[{"id":"5081","ticker":"how-many-more-tweets-will-be-on-the-mcuban-account-on-february-10-2021","slug":"how-many-more-tweets-will-be-on-the-mcuban-account-on-february-10-2021","title":"How many more tweets will be on the @MCuban account on February 10, 2021?","description":"This is a market on the number of tweets which will be posted to Mark Cuban's Twitter account prior to the resolution date, February 10, 2021 at 3:00pm EST. \n\nAt 3:00pm EST on the resolution date, the number of total tweets posted by the Twitter account @MCuban, shall exceed 3,453 (the \"Baseline\") by the number or range identified in the contract, as indicated by the number under the label \"TWEETS\" on the account detail viewable on the desktop version of https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/.

The number by which the total tweets at expiration exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to expiration of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Mark Cuban, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the settlement source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, the lowest bracket will resolve to \"Yes\". Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, all contracts in this market will resolve as No. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @MarkCuban will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).","resolutionSource":"tweetdeck.twitter.com","startDate":"2021-02-03T00:00:00Z","creationDate":"2021-02-03T00:00:00Z","endDate":"2021-02-10T00:00:00Z","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-more-tweets-will-be-on-the-mcuban-account-on-february-10-2021-1ab9060a-2834-4d78-8a7d-cf2af41c8f00.png","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-more-tweets-will-be-on-the-mcuban-account-on-february-10-2021-1ab9060a-2834-4d78-8a7d-cf2af41c8f00.png","active":true,"closed":true,"archived":false,"new":false,"featured":false,"restricted":false,"liquidity":0,"volume":52378.58,"openInterest":0,"sortBy":"ascending","category":"US-current-affairs","published_at":"2022-07-27 14:41:26.712+00","createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:41:26.715Z","updatedAt":"2024-04-25T19:15:22.084093Z","competitive":0,"volume24hr":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1mo":0,"volume1yr":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"commentCount":0,"cyom":false,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:41:26.715Z","showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"enableNegRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"requiresTranslation":false}],"creator":"","ready":false,"funded":false,"cyom":false,"competitive":0,"pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"approved":true,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"spread":1,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"lastTradePrice":0,"bestBid":0,"bestAsk":1,"clearBookOnStart":true,"manualActivation":false,"negRiskOther":false,"umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"rfqEnabled":false,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"feesEnabled":false,"requiresTranslation":false},{"id":"75252","question":"Will the Celtics or the Clippers win their February 5th matchup?","conditionId":"0x1241f13399a9ad06bce5c24eedb609148189a1bff7716f315790f5ee5b83c2a2","slug":"will-the-celtics-or-the-clippers-win-their-february-5th-matchup","resolutionSource":"nba.com","endDate":"2021-02-05T00:00:00Z","category":"Sports","liquidity":"0.000091","fee":"20000000000000000","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-the-celtics-or-the-clippers-win-their-february-5th-matchup-28ad0226-9481-4c19-a883-5a8547b0966a.png","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-the-celtics-or-the-clippers-win-their-february-5th-matchup-28ad0226-9481-4c19-a883-5a8547b0966a.png","description":"This is a market on which team will win the February 5th, 2021 matchup between the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Clippers.

The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).","resolutionSource":"https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/","startDate":"2021-02-25T00:00:00Z","creationDate":"2021-02-25T00:00:00Z","endDate":"2021-03-04T00:00:00Z","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-more-tweets-will-be-on-the-whcos-account-on-march-4-2021-90eb8dee-4ac8-45c6-9451-bdd8dba11dec.png","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-more-tweets-will-be-on-the-whcos-account-on-march-4-2021-90eb8dee-4ac8-45c6-9451-bdd8dba11dec.png","active":true,"closed":true,"archived":false,"new":false,"featured":false,"restricted":false,"liquidity":0,"volume":21581.53,"openInterest":0,"sortBy":"ascending","category":"US-current-affairs","published_at":"2022-07-27 14:41:43.207+00","createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:41:43.21Z","updatedAt":"2024-04-25T20:57:26.963614Z","competitive":0,"volume24hr":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1mo":0,"volume1yr":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"commentCount":0,"cyom":false,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:41:43.21Z","showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"enableNegRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"requiresTranslation":false}],"creator":"","ready":false,"funded":false,"cyom":false,"competitive":0,"pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"approved":true,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"spread":1,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"lastTradePrice":0,"bestBid":0,"bestAsk":1,"clearBookOnStart":true,"manualActivation":false,"negRiskOther":false,"umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"rfqEnabled":false,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"feesEnabled":false,"requiresTranslation":false},{"id":"98109","question":"Will Beeple's \"Everydays: The First 5000 Days\" sell for more than $10 million in its Christie's auction?","conditionId":"0x35cbb80a6266e9ce3509e70bd6a441c3a9f5c2a5e112b589ca6582b5619a4e1e","slug":"will-beeple-s-everydays-the-first-5000-days-sell-for-more-than-10-million-in-its-christie-s-auction","resolutionSource":"https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/first-open-beeple/beeple-b-1981-1/112924","endDate":"2021-03-11T00:00:00Z","category":"NFTs","liquidity":"0.000088","fee":"20000000000000000","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-beeples-everydays-the-first-5000-days-sell-for-more-than-10-million-in-its-christies-auction-a71586bf-bb54-4153-bc0e-4f6ac323d91f.png","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-beeples-everydays-the-first-5000-days-sell-for-more-than-10-million-in-its-christies-auction-a71586bf-bb54-4153-bc0e-4f6ac323d91f.png","description":"This is a market on whether the final sale price for Beeple’s \"Everydays: The First 5000 Days\", currently on auction at Christie's, will be above $10 million.

The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).","resolutionSource":"https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/","startDate":"2021-03-05T00:00:00Z","creationDate":"2021-03-05T00:00:00Z","endDate":"2021-03-12T00:00:00Z","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-more-tweets-will-be-on-the-whcos-account-on-march-12-2021-3363d0e0-ef59-4b48-a3e2-c5ab8e42cb45.png","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-more-tweets-will-be-on-the-whcos-account-on-march-12-2021-3363d0e0-ef59-4b48-a3e2-c5ab8e42cb45.png","active":true,"closed":true,"archived":false,"new":false,"featured":false,"restricted":false,"liquidity":0,"volume":16535.68,"openInterest":0,"sortBy":"ascending","category":"US-current-affairs","published_at":"2022-07-27 14:41:42.564+00","createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:41:42.567Z","updatedAt":"2024-04-25T19:48:09.233959Z","competitive":0,"volume24hr":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1mo":0,"volume1yr":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"commentCount":0,"cyom":false,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:41:42.567Z","showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"enableNegRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"requiresTranslation":false}],"creator":"","ready":false,"funded":false,"cyom":false,"competitive":0,"pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"approved":true,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"spread":1,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"lastTradePrice":0,"bestBid":0,"bestAsk":1,"clearBookOnStart":true,"manualActivation":false,"negRiskOther":false,"umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"rfqEnabled":false,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"feesEnabled":false,"requiresTranslation":false},{"id":"100873","question":"Will Andrew Cuomo be Governor of New York on June 1, 2021?","conditionId":"0xaa952415e820cf23b46e7333dec3de30034609d2da4d5d600d104d00b881a783","slug":"will-andrew-cuomo-be-governor-of-new-york-on-june-1-2021","resolutionSource":"https://www.governor.ny.gov/","endDate":"2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","category":"US-current-affairs","liquidity":"4.118237","fee":"20000000000000000","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-andrew-cuomo-be-governor-of-new-york-on-june-1-2021-d41e5550-6380-49f0-88d6-f8e11e46adb0.png","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-andrew-cuomo-be-governor-of-new-york-on-june-1-2021-d41e5550-6380-49f0-88d6-f8e11e46adb0.png","description":"This is a market on whether Andrew Cuomo will be governor of New York on June 1, 2021, 12:00 pm ET.

If the resolution date is reached and none of the projects have a token, the market will resolve to \"No\". In the case of ambiguity, the market will be resolved in good faith by the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).","startDate":"2021-03-07T00:00:00Z","creationDate":"2021-03-07T00:00:00Z","endDate":"2021-04-30T00:00:00Z","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-any-of-superrare-zora-foundation-opensea-or-niftygateway-have-a-live-token-by-april-30th-2021-36031a6a-1b24-4f9d-916f-13d2afd286ec.png","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-any-of-superrare-zora-foundation-opensea-or-niftygateway-have-a-live-token-by-april-30th-2021-36031a6a-1b24-4f9d-916f-13d2afd286ec.png","active":true,"closed":true,"archived":false,"new":false,"featured":false,"restricted":false,"liquidity":0,"volume":38035.4,"openInterest":0,"sortBy":"ascending","category":"Crypto","published_at":"2022-07-27 14:41:33.417+00","createdAt":"2022-07-27T14:41:33.42Z","updatedAt":"2024-04-23T22:59:45.636798Z","competitive":0,"volume24hr":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1mo":0,"volume1yr":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"commentCount":0,"cyom":false,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:41:33.42Z","showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"enableNegRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"requiresTranslation":false}],"creator":"","ready":false,"funded":false,"cyom":false,"competitive":0,"pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"approved":true,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"spread":1,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"lastTradePrice":0,"bestBid":0,"bestAsk":1,"clearBookOnStart":true,"manualActivation":false,"negRiskOther":false,"umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"rfqEnabled":false,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"feesEnabled":false,"requiresTranslation":false},{"id":"101786","question":"Will Bitcoin ($BTC) be above $55k on April 1, 2021?","conditionId":"0x5d78c08a39933a6d6b099303b0826704975708221ac7c013e324b2120d94d340","slug":"will-bitcoin-btc-be-above-55k-on-april-1-2021","resolutionSource":"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/","endDate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","category":"Crypto","liquidity":"37.896699","fee":"20000000000000000","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-bitcoin-btc-be-above-55k-on-april-1-2021-518b76df-314c-4029-8504-0f842afe20d5.png","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-bitcoin-btc-be-above-55k-on-april-1-2021-518b76df-314c-4029-8504-0f842afe20d5.png","description":"This is a market on if the USD price of Bitcoin $BTC will be above $55000 on April 1, 2021, 12:00 PM ET, according to coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/.
