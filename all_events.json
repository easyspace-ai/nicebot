In the case of ties, the market will use standard competition ranking (\"1224\" ranking),  where each game's ranking number is 1 plus the number of games ranked above it.\n","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","outcomePrices":"[\"0.9999993704218810278230827151838988\", \"0.0000006295781189721769172848161011607476\"]","volume":"9266.403901","active":true,"marketType":"normal","closed":true,"marketMakerAddress":"0xB7C6cD4879f4FF08C7A3D362fB99CD8EbeA5E9AD","updatedBy":15,"createdAt":"2022-03-30T23:33:16.961Z","updatedAt":"2024-04-23T00:33:04.671029Z","closedTime":"2022-04-16 07:48:04+00","wideFormat":false,"new":false,"sentDiscord":false,"mailchimpTag":"4010504","featured":false,"submitted_by":"0x400567bc06000e36db66f725f16d08f4C579D1Fe","twitterCardLocation":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-lost-ark-be-in-the-top-5-most-played-games-on-steam-on-april-15-2022.png?1649812377554","twitterCardLastRefreshed":"1649812377554","archived":false,"resolvedBy":"0xCB1822859cEF82Cd2Eb4E6276C7916e692995130","restricted":true,"groupItemTitle":"","questionID":"0x5deee4c89a40468d54caee55c4bc3df3cbcf9e763074a277f9085be49745d745","umaEndDate":"April 25, 2022","enableOrderBook":false,"umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","volumeNum":9266.4,"liquidityNum":150,"endDateIso":"2022-04-15","startDateIso":"2022-04-04","umaEndDateIso":"2022-04-25","hasReviewedDates":true,"readyForCron":true,"volume24hr":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1mo":0,"volume1yr":0,"clobTokenIds":"[\"90320291785671756208825228059451212609259551307148421048773274754678011165898\", \"15557113895767324162329036450281865274861759993212826884533767436390225252537\"]","fpmmLive":true,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"creator":"","ready":false,"funded":false,"cyom":false,"competitive":0,"pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"approved":true,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"spread":1,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"lastTradePrice":0,"bestBid":0,"bestAsk":1,"clearBookOnStart":true,"manualActivation":false,"negRiskOther":false,"umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"rfqEnabled":false,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"feesEnabled":false,"requiresTranslation":false}],"tags":[{"id":"100215","label":"All","slug":"all","forceShow":false,"updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:27:54.040735Z","requiresTranslation":false}],"cyom":false,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:40:02.908Z","showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"enableNegRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"requiresTranslation":false},{"id":"2908","ticker":"2022-nba-playoffs-round-2-who-will-win-celtics-vs-bucks","slug":"2022-nba-playoffs-round-2-who-will-win-celtics-vs-bucks","title":"2022 NBA Playoffs, Round 2: Who will win Celtics vs. Bucks?","description":"The 2022 NBA playoffs is the main postseason tournament of the 2021–22 season.

In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).","outcomes":"[\"Long\", \"Short\"]","outcomePrices":"[\"0.5365708088518083161090425765701906\", \"0.4634291911481916838909574234298094\"]","volume":"2406.232656","active":true,"marketType":"scalar","formatType":"normal","closed":true,"marketMakerAddress":"0xe9947faB6Abb55769ecc8Fdd4B17ffbAf73776ba","updatedBy":3,"createdAt":"2021-04-19T15:55:04.228Z","updatedAt":"2024-04-26T02:45:30.45748Z","closedTime":"2021-04-30 06:09:29+00","wideFormat":false,"new":false,"sentDiscord":false,"mailchimpTag":"null","featured":false,"archived":false,"restricted":false,"volumeNum":2406.23,"liquidityNum":2,"endDateIso":"2021-04-27","hasReviewedDates":true,"readyForCron":true,"volume24hr":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1mo":0,"volume1yr":0,"clobTokenIds":"[\"61843736512545700380584324607955917092285261986378934237855103435162003764597\", \"21753427659790952496592950387308584059952494777972738872451505083809874382086\"]","fpmmLive":true,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"liquidityAmm":2,"creator":"","ready":false,"funded":false,"cyom":false,"competitive":0,"pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"approved":true,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"spread":1,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"lastTradePrice":0,"bestBid":0,"bestAsk":1,"clearBookOnStart":true,"manualActivation":false,"negRiskOther":false,"umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"rfqEnabled":false,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"feesEnabled":false,"requiresTranslation":false}],"tags":[{"id":"100215","label":"All","slug":"all","forceShow":false,"updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:27:54.040735Z","requiresTranslation":false}],"cyom":false,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:40:06.984Z","showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"enableNegRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"requiresTranslation":false},{"id":"2998","ticker":"will-the-floor-price-of-azuki-be-26-eth-or-more-on-may-15","slug":"will-the-floor-price-of-azuki-be-26-eth-or-more-on-may-15","title":"Will the floor price of Azuki be 26 ETH or more on May 15?","description":"This is a market on whether Azuki will have a floor price of 26 ETH or more on May 15, 2022 (at 12:00 PM ET), according to https://opensea.io/collection/azuki.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if, on the aforementioned check time, there are no Azukis* listed for sale for less than 26 ETH on the official Azuki collection page on OpenSea.

If no other credible sources are available, the sources will be checked every 24 hours until November 28, 2021 when the market will resolve 50-50.","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","outcomePrices":"[\"0.9999997608939380534428208037609849\", \"0.000000239106061946557179196239015137629\"]","volume":"14395.863729","active":true,"marketType":"normal","closed":true,"marketMakerAddress":"0xE917A5C1a13AD94c6aAF5A9ed0f48187DD0Dd7f2","updatedBy":15,"createdAt":"2021-10-05T16:58:17.792Z","updatedAt":"2024-04-24T23:59:01.092019Z","closedTime":"2021-10-29 04:13:06+00","wideFormat":false,"new":false,"sentDiscord":false,"featured":false,"submitted_by":"LifeWillBeOkay","twitterCardLocation":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-new-world-be-a-top-3-game-on-steam-one-month-after-release.png?1635480642463","twitterCardLastRefreshed":"1635480642463","twitterCardLastValidated":"1635480099.6026473","archived":false,"restricted":false,"volumeNum":14395.86,"liquidityNum":299,"endDateIso":"2021-10-28","startDateIso":"2021-10-05","hasReviewedDates":true,"readyForCron":true,"volume24hr":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1mo":0,"volume1yr":0,"clobTokenIds":"[\"14841864506386751512767120282763789835154327286137606369857734281716141197469\", \"27799369308421429153512926395789614909016566913801911233437557830317924787940\"]","fpmmLive":true,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"creator":"","ready":false,"funded":false,"cyom":false,"competitive":0,"pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"approved":true,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"spread":1,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"lastTradePrice":0,"bestBid":0,"bestAsk":1,"clearBookOnStart":true,"manualActivation":false,"negRiskOther":false,"umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"rfqEnabled":false,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"feesEnabled":false,"requiresTranslation":false}],"tags":[{"id":"100215","label":"All","slug":"all","forceShow":false,"updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:27:54.040735Z","requiresTranslation":false}],"cyom":false,"closedTime":"2022-07-27T14:40:10.573Z","showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"enableNegRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"requiresTranslation":false},{"id":"3087","ticker":"will-there-be-more-than-1k-daily-covid-19-cases-in-japan-on-august-27","slug":"will-there-be-more-than-1k-daily-covid-19-cases-in-japan-on-august-27","title":"Will there be more than 1K daily COVID-19 cases in Japan on August 27?","description":"This is a market on whether there will be more than 1k daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Japan on August 27, 2021.
